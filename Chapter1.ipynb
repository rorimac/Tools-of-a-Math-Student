If you have a 64 processor then choose the Windows x86-64 MSI installer, if you don't or don't know, choose the Windows x86 MSI installer. Run the installer to get the latest version of python installed. Check that you have installed python by opening your command prompt (open your start menu and search for 'command') and write python. If you have python installed you will be in the command prompt of python. To check your current python version, you'll write your first python code:"
